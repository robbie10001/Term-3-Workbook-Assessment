####Q1. Provide an overview and description of a standard source control process for a large project.

#####What is Source Control 

Source control, also known as version control is a way for developers to maintain their source code throughout a projects development. Source control allows programmers to keep track and manage changes to their code. 

As part of a large project, source control processes allow developers to track code changes and allows developers to use previous editions of their code if this is necessary. Version control, also allows teams to develop applications in a collaborative way while also allowing developers to work independently until they have finished a feature of their program. As this is a segment of the program, this can then be integreated into the larger projects in a more controlled way, thereby limiting potential conflicts with the larger project and making error testing and bug identification a more efficient process. 

#####My Source Control Process 

My version control process consists of two elements, GIT and the use of GITHUB. 

######GIT 

GIT is a version control system that was deployed in 2005. It is an example of a distributed version control system. This means that programmers are able to maintain a full history of the changes to their code they wish to keep. They are also able to make different versions of their code through the utilisation of branching. These branches can then eventually be merged with the master branch once new code has been created and made stable for implementation within the larger project. 


One of the key benefits of the use of GIT is that a developer may work on their projects while offline. GIT also had security benefits in that one can keep all of their code locally and therefore not subject to the security threats of the wider web if this is desirous for the developer. 

######GITHUB

GitHub is what is known as a Git repository hosting service. In contrast to GIT, GitHub is web based. This allows for developers to publish their code online. This can enable easier collaboration between developers. If a developer chooses, they can have their code published publicly. GitHub also provides a user-friendly interface for programmers to look at their programs and see the history of changes made to their code. 

One of the key features of GitHub, is forking, which allows users to copy of the code of other programmers. These facilitates collaboration and improves the ability of programmers to work in groups.
