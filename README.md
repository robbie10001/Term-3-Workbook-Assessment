####Q1. Provide an overview and description of a standard source control process for a large project.

#####What is Source Control 

Source control, also known as version control is a way for developers to maintain their source code throughout a projects development. Source control allows programmers to keep track and manage changes to their code. 

As part of a large project, source control processes allow developers to track code changes and allows developers to use previous editions of their code if this is necessary. Version control, also allows teams to develop applications in a collaborative way while also allowing developers to work independently until they have finished a feature of their program. As this is a segment of the program, this can then be integreated into the larger projects in a more controlled way, thereby limiting potential conflicts with the larger project and making error testing and bug identification a more efficient process. 

#####My Source Control Process 

My version control process consists of two elements, GIT and the use of GITHUB. 

######GIT 

GIT is a version control system that was deployed in 2005. It is an example of a distributed version control system. This means that programmers are able to maintain a full history of the changes to their code they wish to keep. They are also able to make different versions of their code through the utilisation of branching. These branches can then eventually be merged with the master branch once new code has been created and made stable for implementation within the larger project. 


One of the key benefits of the use of GIT is that a developer may work on their projects while offline. GIT also had security benefits in that one can keep all of their code locally and therefore not subject to the security threats of the wider web if this is desirous for the developer. 

######GITHUB

GitHub is what is known as a Git repository hosting service. In contrast to GIT, GitHub is web based. This allows for developers to publish their code online. This can enable easier collaboration between developers. If a developer chooses, they can have their code published publicly. GitHub also provides a user-friendly interface for programmers to look at their programs and see the history of changes made to their code. 

One of the key features of GitHub, is forking, which allows users to copy of the code of other programmers. These facilitates collaboration and improves the ability of programmers to work in groups. 

####Q2. What are the most important aspects of quality software?

Software is an invasive force within modernity. It is for this reason that quality in terms of software is so critical. In terms of the most important aspects of quality software I would argue that reliability, security, modifiability, testability, efficiency and maintainability are most critical. 

Reliability, is the notion that the software that we create or interact with behaves in logical and consistent ways.  For our users, this means that they interact with the software in a seamless reliable way. For example, Errors should be handled and our programs should run in a consistent manner.

Security, is a metric by which we can assess the ability of our software to be protected against potential security breaches. This metric can be measured against the number and seriousness of the vulnerabilities found within software. Poor security is often the result of poor coding and overall weaknesses within the structures of our software. For example, not having proper user authentication which can make certain aspects of our application susceptible to security breaches. 

Modifiability, this is the idea by which it should be easy to change, add, update or delete elements within our software. In highly modifiable software, we are able to alter the performance of our applications with minimal changes to our programs code. For example, the ability to change what renders to our screens through the use of components in react over not using components and hardcoding each line of code. 

Testability, is the idea that our code should be easily testable in order to verify its functionality. Automated testing is an important aspect of the testability of a program. Each feature that we implement within our programs should be easily testable. We should also be able to verify that our programs are running as expected.  For example, we should run each component of our applications that contains logic through tests to insure that our program performs as we anticipate. 

Efficiency, is the use of as few resources as possible. Our programs should not have an excess of code and run as fast as possible. We should minimise API, database and external calls as much as possible. Efficiency can be seen as the antithesis of code bloat. It is similar in notion to the DRY principle in coding in that we want to be as efficient was possible with our software. 

Maintainability, is the easy by which we are able to upkeep our code. This includes the easy by which we can modify, adapt or alter our software. Software maintainability can be achieved by following company regulations and coding conventions. For example, insuring that proper indenting is applied makes ones code easier for other developers to use and therefore makes the code more maintainable over the long run.
